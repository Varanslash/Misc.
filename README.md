# README
This readme is for any files that would need further explanation, whether it be to avoid harm or explain confusing parts. If you need any files in this repo explained, make an issue and I'll add it when I have the time.

## tool.ps1
tool.ps1 is a joke virus that doubles as my first Powershell script. It's not malicious, and all it does is write clutter to Downloads.

Essentially what this virus does is show a message box with a message reminiscent of "you are an idiot" from a while ago, 
then spawns a .txt file with the title "YOUR COMPUTER HAS BEEN INFECTED" and text saying "you are an idiot". That's about it.

If you want further explanation on the script, ask a knowledgeable friend or paste it into ChatGPT, and if you don't feel safe running it, I won't mind! Just don't
run it and move on with your day.

Have fun nerds!
